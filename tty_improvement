To help with creating a fully functional TTY shell in an engagement try the following:

On victim
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
Ctrl-z

On attacker
echo $TERM # note down
stty -a # note down rows and cols
stty raw -echo # this may be enough
fg

On victim
reset
export SHELL=bash
export TERM=xterm
stty rows 38 columns 225


This should help make a semi-interactive shell into a more fully functional shell, but will cause issues with the attacker terminal session if the shell drops.
This is due to the stty raw -echo
